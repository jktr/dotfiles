! disable capslock
! TODO decide on a remapping for capslock:
!   Meta? - get Alt back in emacs, but alt is kinda unused
!   Ctrl/Escape - for easy reach, but requires relearning
!   Hyper - extra modifier, but unsure of usefulness
!   Undo/Redo - useful in emacs, but not (?) used elsewhere
!   something else entirely?
clear lock

! natural scroll
