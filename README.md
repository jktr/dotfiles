# dotfiles

These are my configuration files for linux systems.

I keep conditional code out of the main branch;
patchsets for other distros can be found as separate branches.
Not all of these are public.

Deployment happens via the `dotdeploy` script; I only happen
to continue using it because it still works. There are better
alternatives for dotfile management available today.

Maybe you'll get some use out of me publishing this.
